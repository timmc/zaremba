/**
 * Definitions:
 *
 * - `Pk` is the kth prime, and is usually used when the first k primes are to
 *   be multiplied together; `zStepPk` refers to the number of primes that must
 *   be multiplied to form the step size for z.
 * - `Waterfall` refers to either a number in OEIS A025487, or the list of
 *   exponents themselves. Where p_i are the consecutive primes starting with
 *   p_1 = 2, and n has prime factorization `p_1^a_1 * p_2^a_2 * ... * p_k^a_k`
 *   then it is a waterfall number if `a_1 >= a_2 >= a_3 >= ... >= a_k`.
 *   Simply put, there are no gaps in the prime factorization and the exponents
 *   are non-ascending. For example, `10080 = (2^5)(3^2)(5^1)(7^1)`.
